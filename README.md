## How to use:

When picking a lock in Oblivion, the pegs fall at one of four speeds. The slower the speed, the easier it is to lock the peg in place. These fall speeds follow a predictable pattern. With this website, you can keep track of the fall speeds for each peg to easily pick high difficulty locks at any character security level.
